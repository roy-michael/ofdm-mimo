### Assignment

1. **Simulate the Channel A** in the table below:
* Compute the response at some $t_0$ 
* Compare the response at $t_0 + \Delta_1$, where $\Delta_1$ << $T_c$ (Short time, high correlation)
* Compare the response at $t_0 + \Delta_2$, where $\Delta_2$ >> $T_c$  (Long time, low correlation)



**Channel A Parameters:**

| Tap | Relative Delay (ns) | Average Power (dB) | Doppler Spectrum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 0.0 | Classic |
| 2 | 310 | -1.0 | Classic |
| 3 | 710 | -9.0 | Classic |
| 4 | 1090 | -10.0 | Classic |
| 5 | 1730 | -15.0 | Classic |
| 6 | 2510 | -20.0 | Classic |
